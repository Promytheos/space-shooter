# Space Shooter:

Single player game with multiple areas. The player will sit at the bottom of the screen and dodge and/or shoot at objects/enemies falling towards them. Player will have a skill tree allowing them to acquire/level up skills. There will be increasingly difficult boss fights per level building up to a major boss fight.

## Controls:

Left/Right Arrow keys and A/D will be used to move the player, while space bar will be used to shoot and shift will be used to activate any power-ups for a period of time.

## Enemies:

Enemies will be different from falling objects. They will be able to move left and right and will hover until shot down at which point they become a falling object until destroyed by the player's shots. Depending on the difficulty, enemies will shoot at the players. Some enemies will move left/right and shoot randomly while some will specifically target the player.

## Falling Objects:

Falling objects will move downward at a fixed rate. Upon colliding with the player, objects will do damage to a player until the player has taken too much damage and dies.

## Boss Fights:

There will be 3 levels (subject to change) of boss fights.

#### Level 1:

Multiple Enemies shooting at player

#### Level 2:

Multiple Enemies plus one mid-sized boss

#### Level 3:

Multiple Enemies, multiple mid-sized bosses and one large boss

This will be re-visited once difficulty has been ascertained

## Skill Tree:

Start with 3 base skills. These will define/guide how the player plays the game.
There will be three types of skill paths:

#### Speedy Boi:

This will come with skills allowing the player to be nimble and agile. Some ideas for skills in this tree include:

* Dash Dodge - the player will quickly shoot to the side to dodge an object
* Dash Ahead - the player will speed up and skip a small portion of the objects. If a boss fight is in this portion, the fight will begin as soon as the dash anim ends.
* Dash forward - the player will be able to move as much as halfway up the screen with the up/down or W/S keys

#### Defendy Boi:

This will come with skills allowing the player to take large amounts of damage without dying or losing health. Some ideas for skills in this tree include:

* Shield - the player will be able to activate a shield for a period which will block shots/falling objects from damaging the player
* Passthrough - the player will not take any damage from objects for a period (NB: review this)
* Reflect - shots fired at the player will reflect back in the direction they came

#### Shooty Boi:

This will come with skills allowing the player to do larger amounts of damage to objects/enemies. Some ideas for skills in this tree include:

* Missiles - slower moving, but high damage explosives. These will insta-kill the object hit by this and do damage to nearby objects in a small radius.
* Laser Beam - Constant fire that can be activated for a period. This will basically be a line spanning the screen insta-killing objects it touches
* Health recovery - this will give the player a small health increase for each object/enemy destroyed (10% object/enemy max health)
